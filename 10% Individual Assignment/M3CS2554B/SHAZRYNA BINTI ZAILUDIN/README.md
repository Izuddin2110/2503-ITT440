###### IMAGE PROCESSING
Image Processing is known as the manipulation of an image to produce desired results, such improving its quality, changing its structure, or extracting crucial information. 

###### PILLOW (PIL)
The Pillow (PIL) package for Python offers strong capabilities for quickly and effectively completing image processing tasks. Pillow allows you to read, edit, crop, resize, rotate, add filters and save photos in a variety of image formats, including JPEG, PNG, and others.  The Python Pillow library is a fork of an older library called PIL. The Python Imaging Library (PIL) was the first library to allow Python to work with images. PIL only supports Python 2 and was deprecated in 2011. According to its creators, Pillow is the amiable PIL fork that supported Python 3 and preserved the library.
