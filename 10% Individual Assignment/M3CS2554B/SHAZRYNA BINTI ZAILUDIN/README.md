###### IMAGE PROCESSING
Image processing is the technique of performing operations on an image to enhance it, extract useful information, or transform it into another format. It is widely used in fields such as computer vision medical imaging, remote sensing, and photography editing. 

###### PILLOW (PIL)
The Pillow (PIL) package for Python offers strong capabilities for quickly and effectively completing image processing tasks. Pillow allows you to read, edit, crop, resize, rotate, add filters and save photos in a variety of image formats, including JPEG, PNG, and others.  The Python Pillow library is a fork of an older library called PIL. The Python Imaging Library (PIL) was the first library to allow Python to work with images. PIL only supports Python 2 and was deprecated in 2011. According to its creators, Pillow is the amiable PIL fork that supported Python 3 and preserved the library.

##### OBJECTIVES
* To explore and apply advanced image processing techniques using the Pillow library.
* To manipulate images through resizing, filtering, rotating, blending, masking, and enhancement.
* To automate a series of image operations through Python programming.
