# RECOGNIZING HAND-WRITTEN DIGITS USING SCIKIT-LEARN
# ALIF ASYRAF BIN AZLAN

## Introduction
Digit recognition is one of the most fundamental tasks in computer vision and machine learning.
It involves automatically identifying and classifying handwritten digits (0‚Äì9) from image data.

### Applications of digit recognition include:
- Automated bank cheque reading
- Postal code sorting
- Touchscreen handwriting input
- Mobile payment systems

In this project, we utilize scikit-learn, a powerful Python library for machine learning, to build a simple yet effective digit recognition system.
We will be using the popular digits dataset available within scikit-learn, which contains 8x8 pixel images of handwritten digits.

## Core Concepts
- **Data Preprocessing**: Preparing the raw digit images by flattening and scaling them for the machine learning model.
- **Feature Extraction**: Using pixel intensities directly as features (since the images are small and simple).
- **Model Training**: Applying a machine learning classifier to learn from the digit images.
- **Evaluation**: Measuring the model‚Äôs performance using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
- **Visualization**: Displaying some sample predictions for easy interpretation.


## Tools Used
- scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and utilities.
- numpy: Numerical operations on arrays.
- matplotlib: Plotting images and results.
