# Image Processing using BoofCV



ðŸŸ¡ Introduction to BoofCV


BoofCV (short for Boof Computer Vision) is an open-source Java library designed for real-time computer vision and image processing. It's fast, lightweight, and very cleanly organized, making it easy to use for both beginners and experts.

It is especially popular when you need a pure Java solution â€” meaning no native libraries like OpenCV's C++ backend are required. This makes it perfect for Java applications, Android apps, robotics, academic projects, and embedded systems.
