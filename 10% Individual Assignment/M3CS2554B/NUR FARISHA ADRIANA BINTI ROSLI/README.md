Image processing is a technique that allows us to modify images to make them better or to gather important information from them. It uses different methods and algorithms to work with images in a digital form. This can involve tasks like enhancing image quality, finding patterns, separating objects, and changing images into various formats. Image processing applies to both pictures and video clips. Typically, the process includes steps like taking the image, applying different algorithms to it, and then producing results that can be used or analyzed further (GeeksforGeeks, 2024). In this part, we will be focusing on the library used in Kornia to develop digital image processing.

Kornia is a unique library that makes it possible to combine traditional computer vision techniques with deep learning models. It includes various routines and modules that can handle common computer vision tasks. The library is built on PyTorch, which helps it run efficiently and allows for easy calculation of gradients for complicated functions using reverse-mode auto-differentiation.
