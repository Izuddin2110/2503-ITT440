**Definition Image Processing**
Image processing enhances images or extracts information using various techniques and algorithms. It improves quality, detects patterns, separates objects, and converts formats for both photos and videos. The process involves capturing an image, applying algorithms, and generating analyzable results. In this part, we will be focusing on the library used in Kornia to develop digital image processing.
