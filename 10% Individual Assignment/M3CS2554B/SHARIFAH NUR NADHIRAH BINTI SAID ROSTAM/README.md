# Image Manipulation with NumPy: Basic Operations and Transformations
#### Overview
This project demonstrates how to manipulate image using the **NumPy** library while the **PIL** library wll be used to access the pixel data stored in an image. It is ideal for understanding how row image data can be manipulated with array-based logic - a foundational concept in computer vision and image processing.

#### Introduction
Image processing is a type of mathematical computation. It demonstrates core in computer vision, involving techniques to manipulate images to extract useful information or modify visual attributes. NumPy was one of the powerful tools that treat image as arrays. NumPy stands for Numerical Python. It is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourirer transform and matrices.
#### Why Numpy for Image Processing?
- **Efficiency**: NumPy can perform a fast array processing due to the highly optimized numerical operations.
- **Simplicity**: It allows direct manipulation of pixel values.
- **Control**: Offers more transparency than using high-level libraries.
#### Which Language is NumPy written in?
NumPy is a Python library and is written partially in Python but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++.
#### Step-by-step Implementation
#### Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy** – for matrix manipulation.
- **OpenCV** – for loading/saving/displaying images.
- **Matplotlib** – for visualization in Jupyter or Python scripts.
The dependencies was included to visualize the results clearly.
#### How to implement?
#### Step 1: Environment Setup
- Python 3.8+
- Python Packages: PIL, NumPy
