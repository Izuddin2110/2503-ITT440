# Image Manipulation with NumPy: Basic Operations and Transformations
## Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform simple image processing tasks using only **NumPy**. It is ideal for understanding how row image data can be manipulated with array-based logic - a foundational concept in computer vision and image processing.
## Introduction
Image processing is a core in computer vision, involving techniques to manipulate images to extract useful information or modify visual attributes.While other libraries like OpenCV and PIL are often used, NumPy offers a powerful low-level approach by treating image as arrays. NumPy stands for Numerical Python. It is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourirer transform and matrices.
## Why Numpy for Image Processing?
- **Efficiency**:
- **Simplicity**:
- **Control**:
## Which Language is NumPy written in?
NumPy is a Python library and is written partially in Python but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++.
