```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
For CPU-only:
bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
2. Install MMDetection
bash
pip install openmim
mim install mmengine
mim install mmcv-full
mim install mmdet
3. Verify Installation
python
import mmdet
print(mmdet.__version__)
If no errors, installation is successful.

üß™ Python Code (Object Detection)
Code Example: Object Detection with Pre-trained Model
python
from mmdet.apis import init_detector, inference_detector
import mmcv

# Config and checkpoint files
config_file = 'configs/faster_rcnn/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py'
checkpoint_file = 'checkpoints/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco_20200130-047c8118.pth'

# Initialize the detector
model = init_detector(config_file, checkpoint_file, device='cuda:0')  # or 'cpu'

# Perform inference on an image
img = 'demo/demo.jpg'
result = inference_detector(model, img)

# Visualize the results
out_img = 'output.jpg'
model.show_result(img, result, out_file=out_img)
print(f"Detection results saved to {out_img}")
Explanation
init_detector ‚Üí Loads a pre-trained model (Faster R-CNN in this case).

inference_detector ‚Üí Runs object detection on an input image.

show_result ‚Üí Draws bounding boxes and saves the output.

(Download the config and checkpoint from MMDetection Model Zoo)

‚úÖ Output Description
output.jpg ‚Üí Image with detected objects highlighted with bounding boxes.

Supported Classes: COCO dataset classes (e.g., person, car, dog, etc.).
