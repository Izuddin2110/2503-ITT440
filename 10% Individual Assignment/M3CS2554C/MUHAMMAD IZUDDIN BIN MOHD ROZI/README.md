**1. INTRODUCTION OF IMAGE PROCESSING**

In the morden era, image processing take a lot of responsibility of making human task more efficient and easy. Image processing is the technique of analyzing, enhancing, and manipulating the images using algorithms, typically using for software and internet of things (IOT). In easy way too understand image processing taking an image as a input and doing something about it. For example improving its quality, detecting object, changing size or colors.

At its core, image processing is divided into two major type which is analog done on physical images using optical or electronic device and second major type if digital done on digital images using computers. In moderan system, digital image processing is far more widespread and accessible, enabling complex operation on images using programming languages and libraries. One of the key benefits of digital image processing is the ability to perform task with speed, accuracy and reproducibility. For example the vital in fields such as medical diagnostics (analyzing X-rays and MRIs), security system (facial recognition), industrial automation (quality inspection), satellite imaging (weather monitoring and land mapping) amd entertainment (filters and effects in apps and games).

As technology advances and visual data becomes increasingly central too communication and decision-making, image processing continues to evolve as a vital field in both research and industry, it acts as a foundation for more advanced topics like computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, allowing the computer to not just look up but also to understand and interpret the visual world.

# What is Scikit-Image?

In simple terms, **Scikit-Image** is a Python library made specifically for image processing and is part of the SciPy ecosystem. It provides ready-to-use functionality for filtering, segmentation, feature detection, restoration, transformation, and more.

# Advantage Using Scikit-Image

- **Ease to use**: High-level functions and no need for deep computer vision knowledge.
- **Powerful tools**: Inside scikit-image, there are ready-made functions for almost all common processing needs like denoising, edge detection, segmentation, and transformations. Each tool uses algorithms that are trusted and proven in scientific communities.
- **Scientific accuracy**: It is designed for real researchers, for example in biology (cell counting), astronomy (star segmentation), and material science (analyzing textures). Functions are mathematically correct and follow peer-reviewed algorithms.

# Features that can be used in scikit-image
