1. INTRODUCTION OF IMAGE PROCESSING

   In the morden era, image processing take a lot of responsibility of making human task more efficient and easy. Image processing is the technique of analyzing, enhancing, and manipulating the images using algorithms, typically using for software and internet of things (IOT). In easy way too understand image processing taking an image as a input and doing something about it. For example improving its quality, detecting object, changing size or colors. 

	At its core, image processing is divided into two major type which is analog done on physical images using optical or electronic device and second major type if digital done on digital images using computers. In moderan system, digital image processing is far more widespread and accessible, enabling complex operation on images using programming languages and libraries. One of the key benefits of digital image processing is the ability to perform task with speed, accuracy and reproducibility. For example the vital in fields such as medical diagnostics (analyzing X-rays and MRIs), security system (facial recognition), industrial automation (quality inspection), satellite imaging (weather monitoring and land mapping) amd entertainment (filters and effects in apps and games).

	As technology advances and visual data becomes increasingly central too communication and decision-making, image processing continues to evolve as a vital field in both research and industry, it acts as a foundation for more advanced topics like computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, allowing the computer to not just look up but also to understand and interpret the visual world.
