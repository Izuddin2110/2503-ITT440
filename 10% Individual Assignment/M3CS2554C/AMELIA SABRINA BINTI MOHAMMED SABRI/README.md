## 💡 Introduction
Image processing is an essential part of computer vision that focuses on enhancing and transforming images to make them more useful for analysis or artistic effects.
Applying filters to images is one of the simplest and most effective ways to explore image processing.
### Applications of image filtering include:
- Photo editing and enhancement
- Medical image analysis
- Object detection preprocessing
- Artistic effects and augmented reality
- Improving image quality for machine learning tasks

In this project, we use OpenCV, a powerful open-source computer vision library, to apply various filters to images, such as grayscale, invert, cartoon, fisheye, and edges.
## 📍 Core Concepts
- Image Reading: Loading the original images using OpenCV.
- Color Transformations: Changing the color space, like converting to grayscale or inverting colors.
- Smoothing: Blurring the image to remove noise and soften details.
- Stylization: Applying artistic effects such as cartoon or fisheye distortion.
- Edge Detection: Finding and highlighting the boundaries inside an image.
- Visualization: Displaying and saving the filtered images for presentation.
## 🛠️ Tools Used
- OpenCV: Image processing functions and filters.
- NumPy: Handling matrix operations for image manipulation.
- Thonny IDE: A Simple Python environment for writing and running code.

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a free and popular open-source library for computer vision and image processing tasks.
Developed by Intel, it is widely used in academia, research, and industry for building real-time image and video processing systems. OpenCV is fast, efficient, and beginner-friendly, especially with Python.
