# OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a free and powerful library used for computer vision and image processing tasks.
Originally developed by Intel, it is widely used in research, industries, and education for projects like image filtering, object detection, and video analysis.
OpenCV is fast, efficient, and beginner-friendly, especially when used with Python.
