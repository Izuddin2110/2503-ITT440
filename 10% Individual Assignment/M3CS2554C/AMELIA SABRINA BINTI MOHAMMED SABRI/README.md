## Image Processing with Filters using OpenCV
## Introduction
Image processing is an essential part of computer vision that focuses on enhancing and transforming images to make them more useful for analysis or artistic effects.
Applying filters to images is one of the simplest and most effective ways to explore image processing.
### Applications of image filtering include:
- Photo editing and enhancement
- Medical image analysis
- Object detection preprocessing
- Artistic effects and augmented reality
- Improving image quality for machine learning tasks

In this project, we use OpenCV, a powerful open-source computer vision library, to apply various filters to images, such as grayscale, invert, cartoon, fisheye, and edges.
