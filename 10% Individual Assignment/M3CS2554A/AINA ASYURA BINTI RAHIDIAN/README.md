### FRAMEWORK

#### Albumenatations

##### What is Albumenatations ?
Albumentations is a fast and flexible Python library used for image augmentation. It's specifically designed to perform various image transformation operations, making it a popular choice for data preprocessing in machine learning and computer vision projects. Albumentations provides a wide range of augmentations, from basic transformations like rotation and flipping to more advanced ones like elastic deformations and random brightness adjustments.

##### Albumenatations Features :
Here are some key features and characteristics of the Albumenatations framework:

1) High Performance: Albumentations is optimized for speed and efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale image processing tasks.
2) Rich Set of Transformations: It offers a wide variety of image augmentations, including flipping, rotating, cropping, brightness/contrast adjustments, blurring, noise addition, and more.
3) Support for Advanced Augmentations: Includes complex transformations like elastic deformation, grid distortion, optical distortion, and CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization).
4) Mask and Keypoint Support: Allows simultaneous augmentation of images, segmentation masks, and keypoints, which is essential for tasks like semantic segmentation and pose estimation
5) Custom Transformations: Users can define their own custom transformations for specialized use cases.
6) Reproducibility: Augmentations can be made deterministic using random seeds, ensuring consistent results when needed.
   
###### Exact code used:
```py
import cv2
import albumentations as A
from albumentations.pytorch import ToTensorV2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the image using OpenCV
image = cv2.imread("example.jpg")
image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# Define the Albumentations transformation pipeline
transform = A.Compose([
    A.Resize(256, 256),
    A.HorizontalFlip(p=0.5),
    A.RandomBrightnessContrast(p=0.2),
    A.Rotate(limit=15, p=0.3),
    A.Normalize(mean=(0.485, 0.456, 0.406), std=(0.229, 0.224, 0.225)),
    ToTensorV2()
])

# Apply the transformation
augmented = transform(image=image)
augmented_image = augmented['image']

# Convert tensor to numpy format for visualization
augmented_image_np = augmented_image.permute(1, 2, 0).numpy()

# Display the augmented image
plt.imshow(augmented_image_np)
plt.title("Augmented Image")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```
