**What is Image Processing ?**

Image processing is the manipulation and analysis of images to extract meaningful information, enhance their visual quality or prepare them for further use. It involves converting images into digital formats and applying algorithms to modify them, often for purposes like enhancement, restoration, compression or analysis.

**What is NumPy?**

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects(such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on array, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transform, basic linear algebra, basic statistical oprations, random simulation and much more. 

**Why use NumPy?**

NumPy is used because it provides efficient and convenient tools for numerical computation in Python. It introduces the ndarray, a powerful data structure for handling arrays of numerical data and offers a rich set of functions for performing mathematical operations on these arrays. The advantages of using NumPy include:

**Advantage of NumPy :**

Effiency:
NumPy arrays are implemented in C, allowing for faster computation compared to Pyhton lists, especially when dealing with large datasets. Numpy leverages vectorized operations, which eliminate explicit loops and array indexing, further enhancing performance.
