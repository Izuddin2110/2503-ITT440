## APPLICATION OF YOLO IN PYTHON FOR COMPUTER VISION AND GRAPHICS  
### ðŸ§  WHAT IS COMPUTER VISION & GRAPHICS (CVG) ?
The growth of Computer vision and graphics has led to substantial impact on the world. Computer vision is a part of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to derive valuable data from visual inputs like photos and videos. The AI utilizes machine learning and neural networks to train computers and systems to extract the information from digital images and videos. To put it another way , it mimics human vision - where we perform visual tasks and retrieve the information.  Applications of computer vision include recognition, autonomous vehicles, security systems and medical imaging. Computer vision plays an important role in making systems more efficient, innovative and intelligent.

You Only Look Once (YOLO) is an algorithm that is capable of detecting real-time objects. This is accomplished by technology called convolutional neural networks (CNN) that can predict various bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from the complete image in one evaluation. The YOLO model can process images in real-time at 45 frames per second which make it incredibly fast and efficient. It is used across multiple industry fields such as the medical sector for x-rays, MRIs or scans. YOLOâ€™s ability to detect objects in real time is ideal for autonomous vehicles, allowing them to recognize and react to objects like other vehicles or traffic signals. Its strong capabilities made it gain popularity and led to rapid growth over the years. 

### ðŸš€ ADVANTAGES OF YOLO IN COMPUTER VISION
 - **Speed**  
      YOLO is **extremely fast** since it does not deal with complex pipelines and deal with single-pass architecture. This means it can process images at high frame rate - within
      milliseconds.
   
- **Accuracy**  
    Not only is it fast, but YOLO also has a **high accuracy rate**. It can achieve state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks meaning it can do real-time object detection with less error rate.

- **Efficiency**  
  YOLO is **incredibly efficient**. It does not require too much computational power. YOLO is still able to achieve comparable results despite having  fewer resources.
  
- **Open-Source**  
  YOLO is an **open-source project**, allowing developers to freely use, alter and improve it. This results in constant community improvement and advancement.
