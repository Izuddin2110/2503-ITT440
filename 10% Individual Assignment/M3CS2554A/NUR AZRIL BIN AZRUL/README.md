## TITLE : INTRODUCTION TO IMAGE PROCESSING USING PYWAVELETS IN PYTHON
### What is Image Processing ?
Image processing in Python involves manipulating and analyzing digital images using various libraries and techniques. It is used to enhance images, extract information, and perform various computer vision tasks. Common applications include image enhancement, object detection, image segmentation, and feature extraction.
### What is Pywavelets ?
PyWavelets is a Python library designed for wavelet analysis, which includes image processing. Wavelet transform decomposes an image into different frequency components, enabling various image processing tasks. These tasks include image compression, denoising, feature extraction, and analysis.
