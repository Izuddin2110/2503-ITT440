<h2>SHAZLEEN HANI BINTI MOHD SUHAIMI JIMMY (2023261282)</h2>

<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
Computer vision is a fast-growing area focused on enabling machines to understand visual data. Scikit-image is a widely used open-source Python library for image processing. Built on SciPy, NumPy, and Matplotlib, it offers a broad set of tools for image manipulation, feature extraction, segmentation, and other essential computer vision tasks for researchers, developers, and data scientists.
<h4>KEY FEATURES</h4>
Scikit-image has the following main capabilities:

  • Color space conversions, including RGB to LAB, HSV, and grayscale.
  
  • Reading and writing images in a range of formats is known as image I/O.
  
  • Filtering: edge detection, median filters, and Gaussian blur.
  
  • Segmentation: Instruments like as thresholding, active contours, and watersheds.
  
  • Morphological processes: opening, closure, dilation, and erosion.
  
  • Feature extraction: HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients), blob detection, and corner detection.
  
  • Geometric changes include resizing, warping, scaling, and rotation.
  
  • Image restoration using deconvolution and denoising.
