### TITLE : INTRODUCTION TO IMAGE PROCESSING USING CUDA IN PYTHON TOOLS

## What is Image Processing ?

Image processing in Python tools the process of altering digital photos in order to improve them, extract useful information, or get them ready for additional examination.  It entails utilizing computer-based tools and mathematical algorithms to manipulate images.

What is CUDA ?

CUDA is a tools in Python language.

NVIDIA created the parallel computing platform and programming model known as CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), which enables programmers to use NVIDIA GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) for general-purpose computing, or GPU computing.
The main features of PyWavelets are:

1D, 2D and nD Forward and Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT and IDWT)
1D, 2D and nD Multilevel DWT and IDWT
1D and 2D Stationary Wavelet Transform (Undecimated Wavelet Transform)
1D and 2D Wavelet Packet decomposition and reconstruction
1D Continuous Wavelet Transform
Computing Approximations of wavelet and scaling functions
Over 100 built-in wavelet filters_ and support for custom wavelets
Single and double precision calculations
Real and complex calculations
Results compatible with Matlab Wavelet Toolbox (TM)
Library related to pywavelets ?
While PyWavelets is powerful on its own, it's often used alongside:

NumPy – For numerical array manipulation (PyWavelets depends on it).
scikit-image (skimage) – For loading, converting, and preparing image formats.
Matplotlib – To visualize the original and processed images.
OpenCV (optional) – For more advanced image manipulation and pre-processing.
These libraries create a full workflow from image loading, transformation, to display and analysis.

Module / Subpackage in PyWavelets
PyWavelets offers the pywt module with key image processing tools such as:

pywt.dwt2() – 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform
pywt.idwt2() – 2D Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform
pywt.wavedec2() – Multilevel 2D wavelet decomposition
pywt.waverec2() – Multilevel 2D wavelet reconstruction
pywt.threshold() – For wavelet-based denoising
These functions are used for tasks like image compression, edge detection, and noise reduction through wavelet-based techniques.
